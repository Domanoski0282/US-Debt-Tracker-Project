# US-Debt-Tracker-Project
Microsoft Excel Project conducted as part of the Analyst Builder Data Analytics Course
U.S. Public Debt Analysis | Excel Data Analytics Project
🔍 Project Summary

Analyzed publicly available U.S. government debt data using Excel to identify time-series trends, growth rates, and debt composition insights. This project demonstrates core data analyst skills, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), metric calculation, and data visualization.

🎯 Business / Analytical Objective

Transform raw public-sector financial data into an analysis-ready dataset and extract insights that explain:

How U.S. public debt changes over time

Which debt components contribute most to overall growth

When periods of accelerated debt growth occur

🧠 Key Analytical Questions

What are the long-term trends in U.S. public debt?

How does year-over-year growth change across time?

How do different debt categories compare in their contribution to total debt?

Are there identifiable seasonal or monthly patterns?
